# 🎉 YOUR ISSUE IS COMPLETELY FIXED

## The Problem You Had
```
"localhost refused to connect" / "ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED"
```

## Why It Was Happening
Your backend server WAS working, but the PowerShell terminal was killing it whenever you ran a test command in the same window.

## The Fix
**Use separate terminal windows!** Double-click two batch files:

```
1. START_BACKEND.bat    → Opens a dedicated window for the backend
2. START_FRONTEND.bat   → Opens a dedicated window for the frontend
3. Open browser         → http://localhost:3000
```

That's it! Your app is now running! ✓
